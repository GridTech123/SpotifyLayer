    <h1>Here is a list of known errors and how to fix them</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>Song name/artist not updating</h4>
    <h5>cause: Something on spotify's side.</h5>
    <h5>fix: Pause and play the song.</h5>
    <hr>
    <h4>Song name/artist says an error occured</h4>
    <h5>cause: You started spotify layer while an ad was playing, the song name has an unsupported character.</h5>
    <h5>fix: There isn't one, you just need to wait for the ad to finish or for the next song to play.</h5>
    <hr>
    <h4>Spotify layer sits on low FPS mode</h4>
    <h5>cause: Your computer doesnt have the resources to run Spotify Layer.</h5>
    <h5>fix: Close other running apps (especially games). If that doesnt fix it your computer is likely not powerful enough to run Spotify Layer.</h5>
    <hr>
    <h4>lyrics not loading</h4>
    <h5>cause: Musix match dosen't have that song in their library. Somtimes this is caused by songs having featured artists because of musix match's way of embedding songs.</h5>
    <h5>fix: Look up the song on <a href="https://www.musixmatch.com">musix match</a></h5>
